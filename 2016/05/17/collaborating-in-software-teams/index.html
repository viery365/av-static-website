        <h5 class='date'>17 May 2016</h5>
    <p>Collaborating and communicating effectively can be particularly challenging under certain circumstances.  Effective "soft skills" are critical in many professions, but especially for groups of programmers collaborating with project managers, designers, clients and other stakeholders.</p>

<p>A particular challenge arises from the communication mindset that one might adopt in order to solve a programming problem, versus the mindset that best supports communicating with another human effectively.</p>

<p>Computers are interesting interlocutors because you can generally ask them just as much as you like and they will continue providing answers.  Sometimes it can be difficult to get the answer you want; but solving a programming problem is often a Holmesian deductive process whereby you construct hypotheses and try to drive towards what you hope is the underlying truth of what is going on.</p>

<p>After several hours of little progress on a problem you may need to restrain yourself and re-focus on higher level project goals, but it's unlikely that the computer will start complaining, or simply shut down and avoid interacting with you in future.</p>

<p>Humans are, in my experience, a different story.  There are some humans who may be willing to continue debating with you until the "deep truth" of a matter is uncovered.  These individuals are perhaps more likely to be found in an academic setting, or to be judged as somewhere along the autistic spectrum; and of course anybody may be happy to have a deep debate if they are sufficiently interested in a topic and not under time pressure to be doing something else.</p>

<p>However, many people seem to find an excess of debate uncomfortable and/or frustrating, particularly if they are not interested in the debate or have something else that they really want to get done.  Unfortunately it's easy for someone with a strong academic or programmatic mindset to create and/or pursue a debate on a topic past the comfort point of other's involved in the dialogue, or indeed those who are simply present and listening.</p>

<p>What those with the academic/programmer mindset may sometimes miss is the social cues that people give to indicate that they are uncomfortable with the intensity or duration of a debate.  People vary enormously in their capacity to give and interpret those social cues.  These cues also vary to different extents across nationalities, cultures and social classes.  A given individual will also wax and wane in their ability to read those cues depending on their level of fatigue, stress, intoxication and so forth.</p>

<h2 id="how-much-debate-is-right-for-your-team">How much debate is right for your team?</h2>

<p>It's important when working with a group to consider carefully how far to pursue a debate.  It may be that there is an important decision to be made that depends on whether certain hypotheses are true; however it makes sense to pick these sorts of battles very carefully.  In particular, fierce debates can make others uncomfortable and put them off contributing their potentially valuable ideas both immediately, and in the long run.</p>

<p>I believe there is also an aspect of ego here.  The desire to continue the debate can be connected to a wish to show that one's position is correct, that one is smart, informed and logical.  There are points where the best thing for the team is to end the debate, but the desire to prove one's point or get the upper hand can make that difficult for some personalities.</p>

<p>This can come in very strongly as regards criticism, or the raising of concerns. When people are criticised they may be tempted to defend their actions, e.g.</p>

<p><strong>Critic</strong>: "I'm not sure that X was a good idea"<br />
<strong>Defender</strong>: "I did X because of Y and we knew that was a problem, and actually it's not that big an issue because of Z and we'll do it differently next time and, and, and …"</p>

<p>There is a particular danger that if you strongly dispute or defend against people's concerns, they may well end up being dis-incentivized to raise those concerns with you in future; and when they really have a problem with you, they may feel that a resolution is impossible.  An alternative approach is to avoid defending your past actions and where possible create space to focus on understanding the concern, e.g.</p>

<p><strong>Critic</strong>: "I'm not sure that X was a good idea"<br />
<strong>Responder</strong>: "That's interesting, what didn't you like about X?"<br />
<strong>Critic</strong>: "Well it seemed too risky; I think we should do more Y in future"<br />
<strong>Responder</strong>: "Ah, and why would Y be less risky?"</p>

<p>Here the responder is employing a questioning tactic to draw out ideas from the critic.  There's still the danger that excessive questioning can sometimes feel like debate, but a small number of carefully chosen and calmly posed questions can go a long way to making the critic feel that they are being listened to and understood.</p>

<p>On occasion there may not be time to draw a critic's ideas out; and fair enough, but unfortunately a defensive reaction can be mis-interpreted as a failure to listen and understand.  I personally find it difficult to avoid debating assertions that I strongly disagree with.  Not stating my alternative point of view feels to me, on an emotional level, that I am conceding to something I disagree with.    However that is no excuse; as a team member, or particularly a team leader, it's critical to assess whether it is the right time to have a debate.</p>

<p>Maybe on a given occasion a debate is needed, but the danger is that the debate is started or continued because of an emotional reaction rather than a rational decision that it's a good time to have a debate on that particular topic with or in front of the team.</p>

<p>In summary, interacting with people is complicated, but the Agile method gives guidance.  Reflect at some regular interval (weekly? monthly?) on how your interactions with other team members are going and try to see where you can change your approach to make those interactions smoother and more effective.</p>
