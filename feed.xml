    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="pair flying" src="/images/pairflying.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2002, I graduated a distance-learning masters in applied mathematics. Every month, the university mailed me an A4 enveloppe containing the course support. I was supposed to learn from the course material and returned the completed assignments within a month. A month later, I would receive an answer key. Should I have a question, I could mail it to the professor and wait for his reply. The whole process was cumbersome. I was often behind schedule. Interactivity was near to zero. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later on, I participated in the MOOC endeavour. The video of the instructor gave a feeling of a one-to-one training session. Discussion forums, deadlines, follow-up mails, peer-reviews grounded the learning process. There were meetups too. And a MOOC about Agile Development using Ruby On Rails offered remote pair-programming sessions between participants. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pair-programmming reuses the rather old organizational pattern of pilot+copilot : double-check, higher focusing, external view, and stronger engagement. You may object that programming is very different from flying. Yes, it is! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But programming requires a strong level of accuracy too. Your pairing fellow is both a watch dog that tells you not to call a library without checking how it works, not to cut and paste code across your work, and an inspiration to experiment with new ways of coding. As some aerobatic aircrafts don&amp;rsquo;t include a copilot seat, some programs are implemented by lone wolves in the wild.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tools like teamviewer, logmein, skype, hangout or joinme have been instrumental to the success of remote pair working. There is still room for improvement:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1) In a face-to-face meeting, there is a desk between the two interlocutors. Webcams should recreate this confortable spacing. I&amp;rsquo;m neither a barber nor a dental professional!
2) Remote working platforms lack of interoperability. Some only run on Windows, some require to install a software, others are more suitable for mobile use&amp;hellip; and don&amp;rsquo;t try to connect to hangout with skype
3) Security is a weak point for all of these platforms. Choosing which window you share, which you don&amp;rsquo;t, masking your passwords or your personal information are not intuitive. In my earlier days, I remembered displaying my passwords on a recorded session. Not so good a security practice!
4) Optimizing the screen definition so that everybody can watch comfortably is not supported either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every desktop application from IDE to word processors will probably include some kind of remote pair working feature sooner or later. C9 already includes some simple pair-programming features, for instance.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bugs in the code? Don&amp;rsquo;t blame me, it&amp;rsquo;s my pair programming partner who fooled around!&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Another free refill?</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="free refill" src="/images/freerefill.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year, I undertook a training session targeting small business manager to teach them how to improve profitability of business projects. The course instructor showed us a rather clear way to deal with profitabiliy. First, you estimate your break-even hourly rate, based on your history. Then, you don&amp;rsquo;t sell any project under the bottom line. After that, you prioritize your work to put the highest priority on the most profitable projects. Finally, you keep any accepted project above the bottom line. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idea is quite simple. It&amp;rsquo;s all down to the execution. I began to schedule my workday according to business priorities preferably to a sense of urgency that overcame me before. Then, everytime I felt I was at risk to hit the bottom line, I shifted my attention towards what I really sold to the client annd I reduced my objectives accordingly. Finally, I was trying to become a project reviewer for a well known MOOC platform. But the hourly rate was much too low. I felt relief to drop my candidature. Paid projects management improved greatly. But, a significant part of my workday, dedicated to volunteer projects, was out of the scope of this effort.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Too many commitments, workaholism, things we begin and we never achieve, any freelance worker faces these contradictions. The inherent contradiction is even stronger when you work on non-paid project. How to prioritize your volunteer works?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ten working hours a day is my upper limit, considering that I&amp;rsquo;m not a computer nerd, I&amp;rsquo;ve got a family, hobbies, and a social life &amp;hellip; I was already busy ten hours a day. Adding anything to my schedule implied removing something else. I have been more or less active on professional social networks for three years. I first thought this commitment would improve my reputation and fuel my prospect pipeline. But in three years, the return was not very encouraging. I felt that my social network activity was fueled by bitterness or anxiety or ego or the three rather than by a clear sense of business opportunity! I decided to forget social networks. Two to three hours a week were freed thanks to this good resolution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I chose to devote these hours to Agile Venture mob programming sessions. It&amp;rsquo;s a real community, with real developers. You can both learn by observing how skilled developers work and by doing things by yourself. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m still in the midstream of my prioritization effort. I&amp;rsquo;ve been very actively participating in MOOCs for five years. My skills greatly improved as a result of this effort.  But choosing which courses to invest on is not easy. Knowledge is a bit like indirects costs. You don&amp;rsquo;t really know how to assign it to your achievements. During the first years, the offer flourished. I tried many courses, from Economy to Computer Sciences. I progressively focused on Computer Science and left courses as they switched to paid offers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I was giving up, a prominent MOOC platform offers me to beta-test courses for free. Free refill is the end of resolution and the beginning of passive hyperactivity! You may begin your training week with a course on Embedded systems and end, on friday, with a course on PythonML on friday, without completing any. Does it make sense to participate in a mob programming session about RSPEC on monday, another one about phoenix on wednesday, on the last one about React on friday, when you only need to develop a small web app with React?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AgileVenture Premium Mob includes some kind of Professional Development Planning Support. I may ask the team to help me clean my training plan. But I&amp;rsquo;m still afraid they will tell me to stop learning Tensor Flow or the nitty gritty of Intel Parallel Architecture if I don&amp;rsquo;t have any prospect to work in these fields in the next year! &lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;So my spike of adding ReCaptcha to the sign up page went pretty well.  It all seems to be passing in CI.  I was expecting lots of the sign up tests to break, but they all passed.  I guess because they don&amp;rsquo;t have javascript enabled?  It tempts me to get this merged in and into the flow.  Or should I be strict and get more detailed tests around them?  I switched on JavaScript and got this error:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;    Given I am not logged in      # features/step_definitions/user_steps.rb:59
      undefined method `submit' for #&amp;lt;Capybara::Poltergeist::Driver:0x007fc4b81becf0&amp;gt; (NoMethodError)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;which appears to derive from Poltergeist not supporting the sign out step below&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight ruby"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;When&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="sr"&gt;/^I sign out$/&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;do&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="n"&gt;page&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;driver&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;submit&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ss"&gt;:delete&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;destroy_user_session_path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So one could spend time converting the tests for the logout, directly (at some test running time cost), and/or investigating how the Poltergeist driver might do the same thing.  It reminds me of a conversation I had with Lokesh the other day about what we want from our tests, that they:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;run fast&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;are reliable&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;catch bugs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;are quick to put together&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The difficulty is getting all these four at the same time.  There&amp;rsquo;s also the question about getting testing at the different levels of acceptance, integration and unit, and the level of black-boxiness they operate with.  Of course my new resolution is to focus my mornings on actually making changes to the website (and surrounding ecosystem), rather than just blogging about the generalities.  I think there&amp;rsquo;s probably a concise blog post on the subject (and maybe I could generate it), but priorities.  Of course my mind is scattered from the intense discussions about microservices for the AsyncVoter project, and so I had resolved this morning to look at another part of the AgileVentures ecosystem, which is the little greeting bot that I have running in node on an Amazon EC2 instance.  Thinking about the funnel of folks coming into AgileVentures, we have something like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;See Google AdWord or hear about us on podcast or through MOOC&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Land on AV website home page&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some set of navigation steps&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Land on the AV Sign up page (hopefully soon with captcha)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sign up&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now after the sign up point, the member is redirected to the Getting Started page, which I just think should mention that a Slack invite has been sent.  Perhaps a flash notice to let them know to check their email for the Slack invite?  One that doesn&amp;rsquo;t dissappear too fast.  Maybe the sign up page itself should say that a slack invite will be sent?  I created an issue for that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;https://github.com/AgileVentures/WebsiteOne/issues/1724&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But is that just re-arranging deck chairs?  So then there&amp;rsquo;s the ongoing flow of how and whether the member works through the &amp;ldquo;getting started&amp;rdquo; page.  There&amp;rsquo;s also the experience they have in Slack.  It&amp;rsquo;s frustrating that we can&amp;rsquo;t have an integrated experience where the Slack &amp;ldquo;chat&amp;rdquo; and website &amp;ldquo;documentation&amp;rdquo; are both available in parallel.  Anyhow, what we do have is this automated greeting when the user joins the Slack instance, which comes from my avatar and looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="automated greeting" src="https://dl.dropbox.com/s/uibnox5ijldnhz8/Screenshot%202017-07-12%2009.50.29.png?dl=1" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now it&amp;rsquo;s not ideal that again we&amp;rsquo;re directing folks to a third party site (GitHub), but that partly reflected my frustration with editing in the Mercury editor in the main AV site.  Part of me wants to tear Mercury out of WSO and replace it with a markdown system, or have pages in WSO pull in from GitHub or something, but is the simpler thing to just try getting that page into Mercury?  Or would it be better to be pointing the new members directly to our AV &amp;ldquo;Getting Started&amp;rdquo; page?  So I did &lt;a href="https://www.agileventures.org/joining-a-project"&gt;that&lt;/a&gt;, and it looks okay, but the contents section still points to GitHub.  I don&amp;rsquo;t know how well we support &amp;ldquo;in page&amp;rdquo; anchors.  It&amp;rsquo;s these little things that make GitHub&amp;rsquo;s markdown so appealing.  Do we replicate?  Point to?  Not sure.  Either way, I&amp;rsquo;m struck by &amp;ldquo;LOTS OF TEXT&amp;rdquo; which is what our design sprint is pointing us away from &amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, we&amp;rsquo;re also paying Amazon, monthly, a small amount for running this bot when we could be doing it cheaper on Azure, so I want to move that over.  Also Federico is keen for me to add the special offer about a free Mob session for liking us on Facebook or following us on Twitter.  I also want to get it set up so others can edit it &amp;hellip; let me at least try and remember how to access that code.  It&amp;rsquo;s in this repo:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;https://github.com/AgileVentures/greeter_bot&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Technically the bot is completely trivial.  I can&amp;rsquo;t immediately access it due to my IP address having changed - so it&amp;rsquo;s time to add the new one to EC2 security; and I&amp;rsquo;m in.  It&amp;rsquo;s just a git repo on a linux box and trivial to update.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s interesting is that this has been running for six months&amp;ndash;no trouble and no tests.  So anyway, I just ended up attempting to deploy the greeter bot on Azure/Dokku, which basically involved:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;git remote add azure-production dokku@agileventures.eastus.cloudapp.azure.com:greeterbot-production
ssh dokku@agileventures.eastus.cloudapp.azure.com apps:create greeterbot-production
ssh dokku@agileventures.eastus.cloudapp.azure.com config:set greeterbot-production GREETER_SLACK_BOT_TOKEN=XXXXXXX
git remote 
git pull origin master
git push azure-production master
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;in the greeter bot directory locally. And maybe that&amp;rsquo;s working?  The logs look promising:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;→ ssh dokku@agileventures.eastus.cloudapp.azure.com logs greeterbot-production
2017-07-12T09:14:08.250109458Z app[web.1]:

2017-07-12T09:14:09.853519358Z app[web.1]: notice: RTM websocket opened
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;of course, we may have the same issue that we had on drie that the container sleeps and the websocket dies, and maybe I should have gone for the (simpler?) option of just deploying an ubuntu box on Azure and copying the thing over there &amp;hellip; I&amp;rsquo;ve shut down the EC2 bot and so we&amp;rsquo;ll run this experiment.  The greeter bot is just waiting for &lt;code&gt;team_join&lt;/code&gt; events, which I&amp;rsquo;m not sure how to simulate, and really the question is will Azure/Dokku work in full round trip with real users on Slack.   Of course I could do a direct test on a secondary Slack instance and create a new user to check it out - actually I could create a new user with some random email address on the main instance, although that means messy test users cluttering up the main Slack. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I guess I just wait for someone new to join - I can always post them the message myself if the Azure/Dokku deploy doesn&amp;rsquo;t work.  I&amp;rsquo;ve burned enough time this morning and it&amp;rsquo;s time to move on to admin/Slack/Emails.  Would have been cleaner to start in the test Slack instance, but now the experiment&amp;rsquo;s in progress &amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If it works Federico and others can submit PRs to change the greeter bot message and even deploy the changes themselves &amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;So what I really meant to do yesterday was to look at the flows going through various pages in the site via Google Analytics.  Here&amp;rsquo;s a view that compares June with May this year:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="behaviour flow around sign up page, may vs jun" src="https://dl.dropbox.com/s/hf47so53v8lnhyw/Screenshot%202017-07-11%2009.23.15.png?dl=1" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s perhaps even more revealing to compare June this year with June last year:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="behaviour flow around sign up page, jun 16 vs jun 17" src="https://dl.dropbox.com/s/j1yzvlujhm0qttm/Screenshot%202017-07-11%2009.27.31.png?dl=1" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What we can see clearly here is the big increase from those viewing &amp;rsquo;/code&amp;rsquo; and &amp;rsquo;/learn&amp;rsquo; (I shortened those and added sign up call to actions at the end of them recently) and the massive increase in those going to &amp;rsquo;/getting-started&amp;rsquo; (a few months back we adjusted it so that you go to &amp;ldquo;getting started&amp;rdquo; after signing in).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of the 1200 people landing on the sign_up page in June, we had 380 just stop there and go no further.  I&amp;rsquo;m wondering if that figure could be improved by the deployment of a privacy policy and re-enabling email signups?  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s perhaps more concerning is the 299 drop offs out of the 793 sessions on the &amp;lsquo;getting started&amp;rsquo; page.  Of course maybe the reality is that we can&amp;rsquo;t change either of these drop off rates significantly.   I&amp;rsquo;ve just experiemented with changes to the &amp;#39;getting started&amp;rsquo; page and so it seems sensible to leave that for a while.  Although maybe we should be A/B testing rather than comparing longitudinally?  Anyhow, I&amp;rsquo;ve got the privacy statement all linked up into the sign up page:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="sign up page with privacy link" src="https://dl.dropbox.com/s/ggj4vgtqytlm5jp/Screenshot%202017-07-11%2009.34.22.png?dl=1" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall I think the page looks pretty good.  We previously fixed up the icons and made both signup methods work, so the only garish thing remaining is this email signup disabled.  I found there&amp;rsquo;s a &lt;a href="https://github.com/plataformatec/devise/wiki/How-To:-Use-Recaptcha-with-Devise"&gt;plugin for devise to add Google&amp;rsquo;s re-captcha&lt;/a&gt;.  Working through it I got stuck with the configuration, but fixed it and put in a PR to the repo with the fix:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;https://github.com/ambethia/recaptcha/pull/231&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and so was rewarded with seeing the following in my local spike:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="first pass at adding recaptcha" src="https://dl.dropbox.com/s/fxj5vfx9wzj5sb3/Screenshot%202017-07-11%2009.54.23.png?dl=1" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;but while I could click on the I&amp;rsquo;m not a robot, I got &amp;ldquo;verification failed&amp;rdquo; after signup:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="verification failed" src="https://dl.dropbox.com/s/bieuh1rayk3l9i7/Screenshot%202017-07-11%2009.55.37.png?dl=1" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All the log was telling me was: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;Filter chain halted as :check_captcha rendered or redirected
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I added byebug to the check_captcha method I&amp;rsquo;d added to the registrations controller:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight ruby"&gt;&lt;code&gt;  &lt;span class="n"&gt;prepend_before_action&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ss"&gt;:check_captcha&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ss"&gt;only: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ss"&gt;:create&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; 

  &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;create&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;super&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;unless&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="vi"&gt;@user&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;new_record?&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="n"&gt;session&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ss"&gt;:omniauth&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kp"&gt;nil&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="n"&gt;flash&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ss"&gt;:user_signup&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'Signed up successfully.'&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="no"&gt;Mailer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;send_welcome_message&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="vi"&gt;@user&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;deliver_now&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="no"&gt;Features&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;enabled?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ss"&gt;:welcome_email&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;


  &lt;span class="kp"&gt;private&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;check_captcha&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;byebug&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;unless&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;verify_recaptcha&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nb"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;resource&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;resource_class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;sign_up_params&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="n"&gt;resource&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;validate&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Look for any other validation errors besides Recaptcha&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="n"&gt;respond_with_navigational&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;resource&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;render&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ss"&gt;:new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stepping through the code there made it look like the verification was failing - nothing else wrong.  The &lt;code&gt;verify_recaptcha&lt;/code&gt; method was returning false &amp;hellip; Not sure what&amp;rsquo;s going wrong there and I have the sinking feeling that adding the captcha, as I have, may screw up the other signup methods.  We&amp;rsquo;ll see.  First I just need proof positive that we can get it to work at all &amp;hellip; It may be that I just can&amp;rsquo;t run it locally like this - I added the &lt;code&gt;localhost&lt;/code&gt; domain to the domains associated with keys to run locally, but maybe there&amp;rsquo;s more needed to run locally.  I can see that there&amp;rsquo;s a domain name verification setting in the reCaptcha settings:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="recaptcha settings" src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/53j9mi92omzrls9/Screenshot%202017-07-11%2010.04.42.png?dl=1" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m just trying a restart &amp;hellip; and another step through &amp;hellip; which seemed to work without any changes.  Hmm, maybe the restart did it &amp;hellip; I also played with the layout to make it all look a little better:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="new layout" src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/la5kden3qy8zsb1/Screenshot%202017-07-11%2010.12.41.png?dl=1" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;which I assume didn&amp;rsquo;t actually change things.  Test again without the byebug &amp;hellip; and that works, although I note I get two &amp;ldquo;signed up successfully messages&amp;rdquo; - tried to screen shot, but they fade out a little fast; would like to fix that.  Also I get nicely redirected to the &amp;ldquo;Getting Started&amp;rdquo; page.  Okay, well that&amp;rsquo;s the spike - sure it breaks lots of things, but might as well push that up as a spike PR to see how it all runs on CI.  Guess we&amp;rsquo;ll need sandboxing &amp;hellip;?  Look at that tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="conflicted" src="/images/conflicted.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m conflicted about what to review on the website next.  Part of me wants to start breaking the &amp;ldquo;Getting Started&amp;rdquo; page up into pieces, and showing animated gifs for each.  There&amp;rsquo;s also the &amp;ldquo;About Us&amp;rdquo; page and the need for privacy statement pages.  We&amp;rsquo;ve also got all the text in the &amp;ldquo;Learn&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Code&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Pair&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Grow&amp;rdquo; sections, but I can also sense many other strands of the web attached there.  The presense of the &amp;ldquo;Email Registrations are temporarily disabled&amp;rdquo; on the &amp;ldquo;Sign up&amp;rdquo; page kind of bothers me.  It feels like it&amp;rsquo;s a bit of a running sore.  That said, no one has complained about it explicitly recently.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We disabled the email registrations a couple of years ago when we were experiencing heavy spam sign ups.  In my &amp;ldquo;simplest first&amp;rdquo; doctrine I suggested just turning it off.  Others did suggest adding captchas and I wasn&amp;rsquo;t enthusiastic because I felt it was a kind of arms race and that we would be adding more functionality that we would have to maintain.  Maybe that was a mistake and I should have encouraged whoever was suggesting the captcha to implement one.  Recently my opinion is evolving. I turned on a &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/recaptcha/intro/"&gt;captcha system&lt;/a&gt; to protect our NHS HLP wiki from spambot sign ups.  It was a pretty straightforward configuration and it seems to have been completely successful in blocking the spam bots.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other thought I have for the sign up page is that by forcing people to sign up via either GitHub or Google, we ensure that more members have already completed the &amp;ldquo;Getting Started&amp;rdquo; step 1 (sign up for GitHub) that I recently removed from the &amp;ldquo;Getting Started&amp;rdquo; page.  Ironically the Google sign up is now sort of redundant since the main reason we wanted to offer that was to enable us to connect people&amp;rsquo;s Google profiles to the data coming back from the Google Hangout plugin.  Since Google retired the API for that plugin 3 months ago we&amp;rsquo;re not getting any telemetry on who starts or joins Hangouts, and we&amp;rsquo;re in the process of looking at how to move over to Jitsi, which uses Gravatar rather than Google Plus.  So what direction does that push us in?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Should we drop the Google sign up?  Re-enable the email signup?  From a user point of view we should be providing the sign up options that are most convenient to the user.  We could be providing Twitter and Facebook login; it doesn&amp;rsquo;t feel like a priority, but having user accounts attached to their various social media identities might be useful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most glaring issue on the Sign up page is the reference to the &amp;ldquo;Privacy statement&amp;rdquo; when we don&amp;rsquo;t actually have one.  I think the priority has to be that privacy statement and then linking it up.  I&amp;rsquo;m also tempted to work on the captcha component so we can remove the increasingly erroneous &amp;ldquo;temporarily disabled&amp;rdquo; - apparently there&amp;rsquo;s a &lt;a href="https://github.com/plataformatec/devise/wiki/How-To:-Use-Recaptcha-with-Devise"&gt;gem&lt;/a&gt; that would allow us to integrate recaptcha with Devise.  Of course that&amp;rsquo;s all part of training Google&amp;rsquo;s AIs, but can we really fight that flow?  There&amp;rsquo;s also the concern that we&amp;rsquo;re not pushing people to get GitHub accounts, but I guess it&amp;rsquo;s better to get as many signed up as possible &amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I&amp;rsquo;ve created a &lt;a href="https://www.agileventures.org/privacy"&gt;privacy policy page&lt;/a&gt; based on the one we have for the NHS wiki.  Now I just need a pull request to link that into the footer and the Sign Up page &amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Still struggling to get back to former health and energy levels.  Pleased to have reviewed and made some changes to the website.  Let&amp;rsquo;s continue.  Looking at &amp;ldquo;Getting Started&amp;rdquo; yesterday made me think about the projects page again.  Effectively the new &amp;ldquo;step 1&amp;rdquo; of &amp;ldquo;Getting Started&amp;rdquo; is a view of the projects that we don&amp;rsquo;t have, i.e. one with project maintainers, tech stacks and links to relevant Slack channels.  There have been recent improvements to the project page, specifically that the main list is now ordered by most recently active on Github, so there is a sense in which the main ordering of the projects is by most active (although it&amp;rsquo;s not clear that that&amp;rsquo;s the ordering) and we&amp;rsquo;ve adjusted the smaller list on the left to be alphabetical (and so consistently ordered), as well as filtering for inactive projects. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, I&amp;rsquo;m not sure that people arriving on the page have much clarity about what&amp;rsquo;s going on.  We also have the issue that projects with attached images have those images very large and overly dominate the page:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://dl.dropbox.com/s/3p6c4ginnxghgdo/Screenshot%202017-07-07%2010.13.22.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It looks like just setting a smaller width on that could address that issue &amp;hellip; and yes, done that; added pull request.  Also noticed that actually we didn&amp;rsquo;t need to crimp the width per se - the bootstrap row/column setting was out of alignment - the column values adding up to 22 rather than 12.  So with a few changes the main project page for Wiki Edu now looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://dl.dropbox.com/s/873yfege210c0n0/Screenshot%202017-07-07%2010.31.40.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I guess what I really wanted to do while blogging this was to work through all the projects in the left hand list and de-activate those that aren&amp;rsquo;t really doing anything at the moment.  I guess I will just blast through that. The other thing I wanted to address was how this layout doesn&amp;rsquo;t really have much precedence in other sites.  I don&amp;rsquo;t know that we are using the layout language that people are familiar with from elsewhere on the web.  Ironically it was just when I took over the project management role that the previous maintainer was trying to get in the project page redesign that had been under way for a long time, but he backed out of that, getting busy with other things and perhaps frustrated that I was asking him to submit pull requests that were super-focused on specific changes, rather than rolling in a collection of things that were unrelated to the main ticket.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps that was a major mistake on my part.  I thought I was bringing in best-practices from other projects that I had worked on, but perhaps we lost a lot of work that could have leapt us forward in terms of the project page layout?  Michael and I chose to focus on the events pages for the main work we did when we first got involved.  To me there were screaming inconsistencies there that needed to be fixed first, but who knows what was the &amp;ldquo;right&amp;rdquo; thing to have done.  We did what we did, making our best judgements, given the information available at the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A layout that was a series of boxes, or rows in the table, would seem to make more sense than two separate lists where the ordering is somewhat unclear. Berkeley&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href="http://projects.saas-class.org/projects"&gt;past project showcase&lt;/a&gt; has a more comprehensible layout in some ways:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://dl.dropbox.com/s/tzf8s3mfpeqzujc/Screenshot%202017-07-07%2010.02.14.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They had another system for future projects that also had a layout that made more sense.  Just looking around I found a great &lt;a href="http://cs169.saas-class.org/faq/external-customer"&gt;guide they have for external &amp;ldquo;customers&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;, and a group of Berkeley students called &lt;a href="https://www.calblueprint.org/"&gt;&amp;ldquo;BluePrint&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; doing the same thing as AgileVentures.  Frustratingly I can&amp;rsquo;t find the portal that the CS169 class uses to allow students to select upcoming projects.  I&amp;rsquo;ve emailed Armando to ask if that&amp;rsquo;s still around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I note we&amp;rsquo;ve got a &lt;a href="https://github.com/AgileVentures/WebsiteOne/issues/1089"&gt;project improvements epic ticket&lt;/a&gt;.  Lots of things to keep trying and improving &amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;p.s. just went and set all projects to &amp;ldquo;inactive&amp;rdquo; and am working through re-activating the ones I know that have activity &amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
