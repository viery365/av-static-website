    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="pair flying" src="/images/pairflying.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2002, I graduated a distance-learning masters in applied mathematics. Every month, the university mailed me an A4 enveloppe containing the course support. I was supposed to learn from the course material and returned the completed assignments within a month. A month later, I would receive an answer key. Should I have a question, I could mail it to the professor and wait for his reply. The whole process was cumbersome. I was often behind schedule. Interactivity was near to zero. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later on, I participated in the MOOC endeavour. The video of the instructor gave a feeling of a one-to-one training session. Discussion forums, deadlines, follow-up mails, peer-reviews grounded the learning process. There were meetups too. And a MOOC about Agile Development using Ruby On Rails offered remote pair-programming sessions between participants. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pair-programmming reuses the rather old organizational pattern of pilot+copilot : double-check, higher focusing, external view, and stronger engagement. You may object that programming is very different from flying. Yes, it is! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But programming requires a strong level of accuracy too. Your pairing fellow is both a watch dog that tells you not to call a library without checking how it works, not to cut and paste code across your work, and an inspiration to experiment with new ways of coding. As some aerobatic aircrafts don&amp;rsquo;t include a copilot seat, some programs are implemented by lone wolves in the wild.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tools like teamviewer, logmein, skype, hangout or joinme have been instrumental to the success of remote pair working. There is still room for improvement:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1) In a face-to-face meeting, there is a desk between the two interlocutors. Webcams should recreate this confortable spacing. I&amp;rsquo;m neither a barber nor a dental professional!
2) Remote working platforms lack of interoperability. Some only run on Windows, some require to install a software, others are more suitable for mobile use&amp;hellip; and don&amp;rsquo;t try to connect to hangout with skype
3) Security is a weak point for all of these platforms. Choosing which window you share, which you don&amp;rsquo;t, masking your passwords or your personal information are not intuitive. In my earlier days, I remembered displaying my passwords on a recorded session. Not so good a security practice!
4) Optimizing the screen definition so that everybody can watch comfortably is not supported either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every desktop application from IDE to word processors will probably include some kind of remote pair working feature sooner or later. C9 already includes some simple pair-programming features, for instance.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bugs in the code? Don&amp;rsquo;t blame me, it&amp;rsquo;s my pair programming partner who fooled around!&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Another free refill?</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="free refill" src="/images/freerefill.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year, I undertook a training session targeting small business manager to teach them how to improve profitability of business projects. The course instructor showed us a rather clear way to deal with profitabiliy. First, you estimate your break-even hourly rate, based on your history. Then, you don&amp;rsquo;t sell any project under the bottom line. After that, you prioritize your work to put the highest priority on the most profitable projects. Finally, you keep any accepted project above the bottom line. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idea is quite simple. It&amp;rsquo;s all down to the execution. I began to schedule my workday according to business priorities preferably to a sense of urgency that overcame me before. Then, everytime I felt I was at risk to hit the bottom line, I shifted my attention towards what I really sold to the client annd I reduced my objectives accordingly. Finally, I was trying to become a project reviewer for a well known MOOC platform. But the hourly rate was much too low. I felt relief to drop my candidature. Paid projects management improved greatly. But, a significant part of my workday, dedicated to volunteer projects, was out of the scope of this effort.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Too many commitments, workaholism, things we begin and we never achieve, any freelance worker faces these contradictions. The inherent contradiction is even stronger when you work on non-paid project. How to prioritize your volunteer works?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ten working hours a day is my upper limit, considering that I&amp;rsquo;m not a computer nerd, I&amp;rsquo;ve got a family, hobbies, and a social life &amp;hellip; I was already busy ten hours a day. Adding anything to my schedule implied removing something else. I have been more or less active on professional social networks for three years. I first thought this commitment would improve my reputation and fuel my prospect pipeline. But in three years, the return was not very encouraging. I felt that my social network activity was fueled by bitterness or anxiety or ego or the three rather than by a clear sense of business opportunity! I decided to forget social networks. Two to three hours a week were freed thanks to this good resolution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I chose to devote these hours to Agile Venture mob programming sessions. It&amp;rsquo;s a real community, with real developers. You can both learn by observing how skilled developers work and by doing things by yourself. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m still in the midstream of my prioritization effort. I&amp;rsquo;ve been very actively participating in MOOCs for five years. My skills greatly improved as a result of this effort.  But choosing which courses to invest on is not easy. Knowledge is a bit like indirects costs. You don&amp;rsquo;t really know how to assign it to your achievements. During the first years, the offer flourished. I tried many courses, from Economy to Computer Sciences. I progressively focused on Computer Science and left courses as they switched to paid offers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I was giving up, a prominent MOOC platform offers me to beta-test courses for free. Free refill is the end of resolution and the beginning of passive hyperactivity! You may begin your training week with a course on Embedded systems and end, on friday, with a course on PythonML on friday, without completing any. Does it make sense to participate in a mob programming session about RSPEC on monday, another one about phoenix on wednesday, on the last one about React on friday, when you only need to develop a small web app with React?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AgileVenture Premium Mob includes some kind of Professional Development Planning Support. I may ask the team to help me clean my training plan. But I&amp;rsquo;m still afraid they will tell me to stop learning Tensor Flow or the nitty gritty of Intel Parallel Architecture if I don&amp;rsquo;t have any prospect to work in these fields in the next year! &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>AV EcoSystem Review Email Failings</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;So I think the main bleed in the AV ecosystem may now be some of the problems we are having with sending emails and them ending up in spam filters.  Hold that thought for a moment and I&amp;rsquo;ll just do my node/mocha/chai &lt;a href="https://gist.github.com/tansaku/718547c89be1ef216dda4e973ea67075"&gt;athletic rep for the morning&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I guess I can afford to do that for a few mornings in a row and start exploring where I can speed up &amp;hellip;, but back to our email issues.  So we sent out 10 emails with a special offer (from support@agileventures.org) last week and as far as I can tell, every single one ended up in spam.  Annoyingly I have to go to slack to grab some info about it, but there&amp;rsquo;s not too much to distract me there today, phew.  So one person who got the email in their spam filter reported that they saw this message from Google:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/Screenshot_2017-09-05-16-59-32.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The message is &amp;ldquo;Why is this message in Spam? It is in violation of Google&amp;rsquo;s recommended email sender guidelines.&amp;rdquo;.  This week we had a new Premium Mob member sign up and so far none of the emails from me via sam@agileventures.org appears to have arrived with them.  I also get warnings of authentication failures from hotmail for several emails I&amp;rsquo;ve sent over the last 6 months.  We need to get to the bottom of this.  Can I replicate the failure above (from gmail) and get more info on what&amp;rsquo;s failing &amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I re-send one of the free trial emails and I find it in my gmail spam folder.  I thought I sent a test of this email and it got through to my sam@neurogrid.com account.  It did.  Anyway, I can now click through to &amp;ldquo;learn more&amp;rdquo; on the email to see why the message got marked as spam.  It links to https://support.google.com/mail/answer/81126?hl=en#authentication&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;Why is it important to authenticate your messages?

Authentication ensures that your messages can be correctly classified. Emails that lack authentication are likely to be rejected or placed in the spam folder, given the high likelihood that they are forged messages used for phishing scams.

In addition, unauthenticated emails with attachments may be outrightly rejected, for security reasons.

To ensure that Gmail can identify you:

* Use a consistent IP address to send bulk mail.
* Keep valid reverse DNS records for the IP address(es) from which you send mail, pointing to your domain.
* Use the same address in the 'From:' header on every bulk mail you send.

We also recommend the following:

* Sign messages with DKIM. We do not authenticate messages signed with keys using fewer than 1024 bits.
* Publish an SPF record.
* Publish a DMARC policy.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now one thing I did do with these 10 message was adjust the From address to be &lt;code&gt;support@agileventures.org&lt;/code&gt; which Thunderbird allows me to do, but maybe that triggered Gmail&amp;rsquo;s spam filter.  That said, I&amp;rsquo;ve had problems just sending from sam@agileventures.org as well, so can that be the whole story? &amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The hotmail failures I have had are like the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;Feedback-Type: auth-failure
User-Agent: XMR/2.2
Version: 1.0
Original-Mail-From: &amp;lt;sam@agileventures.org&amp;gt;
Arrival-Date: Fri, 23 Jun 2017 10:02:07 -0700
Message-ID: &amp;lt;b6a7803d-c6ff-16cd-ed5f-e37569ef4ba5@agileventures.org&amp;gt;
Authentication-Results: hotmail.com; spf=softfail (sender IP is 217.70.183.196; identity alignment result is pass and alignment mode is relaxed) smtp.mailfrom=sam@agileventures.org; dkim=none (identity alignment result is pass and alignment mode is relaxed) header.d=agileventures.org; x-hmca=fail header.id=sam@agileventures.org
Source-IP: 217.70.183.196
Auth-Failure: spf
Reported-Domain: agileventures.org
DKIM-Domain: agileventures.org
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I&amp;rsquo;ve sent off an email to Gandi:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;Hi Gandi,

We've been having trouble sending email from our domain agileventures.org, specifically from sam@agileventures.org which is a gandi mail account.  We are getting reports from hotmail (see below).  These are not bulk or spam email, but messages being sent to individual members of our charity from my Thunderbird email client.

I also note that I cannot send email from sam@agileventures.org from my iPhone, although I can receive.

Are there settings on Gandi's site, or even mail settings that we control that could be used to address these issues to ensure that email gets through?

Many thanks in advance

Best, Sam
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and I guess I will take another pass on this tomorrow, bring it up in the marketing meeting etc.  the funny thing is that hotmail failure messages have often been accompanied by delivery of the message as evidenced by sequences of replies and responses that I&amp;rsquo;m having with the people emailed &amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I&amp;rsquo;ve managed to get to the blog-face a little earlier today despite Slack/Twitter/Email distractions, but I&amp;rsquo;m going to stick to the adding tests flow that I started yesterday as a way of getting some athletic reps in on node testing.  That said, we&amp;rsquo;ve got a fairly serious bleed on our emails getting marked as spam that may prevent me from spending much more time on code in these sessions.  Can I afford a 15 minute rep on node tests every morning for the next two weeks?  So many regular station keeping activities that the days are packed!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyhow, so at least from yesterday we have some tests in the &lt;code&gt;greeter_bot&lt;/code&gt; project.  Let&amp;rsquo;s get to the &lt;code&gt;project_greeter_bot&lt;/code&gt; project.  Where would I start?  Grab the issue id for creating tests from the project itself, that&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href="https://github.com/AgileVentures/project_greeter_bot/issues/5"&gt;https://github.com/AgileVentures/project&lt;em&gt;greeter&lt;/em&gt;bot/issues/5&lt;/a&gt; - funny how it feels like breaking the ice on something in order to push through the little &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m not sure where to start&amp;rdquo; feeling.  Bring up the terminal in the right directory.  No outstanding pull requests on the project, pull the latest code from master:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;tansaku@Samuels-MBP:~/Documents/Github/AgileVentures/project_greeter_bot &lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;master&lt;span class="o"&gt;)]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;
→ git pull origin master
remote: Counting objects: 1, &lt;span class="k"&gt;done&lt;/span&gt;.
remote: Total 1 &lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;delta 0&lt;span class="o"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;, reused 1 &lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;delta 0&lt;span class="o"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;, pack-reused 0
Unpacking objects: 100% &lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;1/1&lt;span class="o"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="k"&gt;done&lt;/span&gt;.
From https://github.com/AgileVentures/project_greeter_bot
 &lt;span class="k"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; branch            master     -&amp;gt; FETCH_HEAD

Feels like there&amp;rsquo;s room for a little automation there &amp;hellip; I&amp;rsquo;ve opened a &lt;a href="https://github.com/mochajs/mocha/issues/2989"&gt;feature suggestion&lt;/a&gt; with Mocha, and in the meantime updated the projects package.json with:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;  &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"scripts"&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span class="o"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

This is the point of the rep - find the pain point that you would not otherwise find if you just copied and pasted the code.  Can I now solve this without resorting to looking up the solution &amp;hellip; It&amp;rsquo;s so tempting to just go look at the correct syntax, but I will force myself to slowly read the error message, &lt;code&gt;SyntaxError: Unexpected token {&lt;/code&gt; so maybe just try dropping the curly braces &amp;hellip; no both the following fail:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;require&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;expect&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'chai'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;require&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'expect'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'chai'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, going to look at yesterday&amp;rsquo;s code &amp;hellip; ah, here&amp;rsquo;s what it should be:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;chai&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;require&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'chai'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;expect&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;chai&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;expect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;hmm, have I been throwing in a mix of Python/React syntax there? :-)  Okay, hopefully this pain point will help me remember - would be great to repeat every day for a few to nail it down - now let&amp;rsquo;s see if I can hook up the test to real code again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Took a bit of a big bite here - moved all the js code into a lib dir, moved all the greetings text/variables to a &lt;code&gt;greetings.js&lt;/code&gt; file, renamed the test files, made loads of things consts, updated package.json with &lt;code&gt;&amp;quot;start&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;node lib/server.js&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt; and tried the following at the end of the &lt;code&gt;greetings.js&lt;/code&gt; file in order for it to be pulled into both test and &lt;code&gt;server.js&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;module&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kr"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;greetings&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;which did not work &amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;tansaku@Samuels-MBP:~/Documents/Github/AgileVentures/project_greeter_bot &lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;5_add_tests&lt;span class="o"&gt;)]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;
→ npm &lt;span class="nb"&gt;test&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;project_greeter_bot@0.0.0 &lt;span class="nb"&gt;test&lt;/span&gt; /Users/tansaku/Documents/GitHub/AgileVentures/project_greeter_bot
&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;mocha &lt;span class="nb"&gt;test&lt;/span&gt;/&lt;span class="k"&gt;**&lt;/span&gt;/&lt;span class="k"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;.js

module.js:471
    throw err;
    ^

Error: Cannot find module &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'greetings'&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;so I&amp;rsquo;m not remembering - try some alternatives?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;module&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;greetings&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kr"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;module&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;greetings&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;neither of these work - I think I&amp;rsquo;m throwing in React syntax again - what&amp;rsquo;s the solution?  Ah I was closer to start with, the export needs to be pluralized:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;module&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;exports&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;greetings&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;but still not working - ah path needed in test with:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kr"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;chai&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;require&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'chai'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kr"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;expect&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;chai&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;expect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kr"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;greetings&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;require&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'../lib/greetings'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;describe&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'Project Greeter bot'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(){&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;it&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'should have greetings'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(){&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;expect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;greetings&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;greeter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;to&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;include&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'something'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, that&amp;rsquo;s it.  Okay, must remember the pluralization on &lt;code&gt;module exports = ...&lt;/code&gt; and that this is different from React&amp;rsquo;s &lt;code&gt;export default &amp;lt;function&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;.  A quick update of the tests to something a little more meaningful, a check that things basically still work running the server locally against the old AV mentors instance and the pull request is in:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/AgileVentures/project_greeter_bot/pull/23"&gt;https://github.com/AgileVentures/project&lt;em&gt;greeter&lt;/em&gt;bot/pull/23&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and I start having thoughts about all the other little pieces to make this into a serious, accessible project:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;use of develop/production modes to avoid confusion over slack IDs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;coherent instructions about getting the project running for new developers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;checking this deploys to Azure&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;setting up GitHub notifications on a #bot-notify channel&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;adding projects to AV getting started and projects &amp;hellip;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For another day I guess - back to the grindstone &amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;p.s. just wondering does the code of conduct hold the maintainers to treat all the contributors with respecting as well as the contributors treating each other with respect? looks like it does &amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Argh, so I got distracted by Slack and blogging and twitter and even though I sat down at the computer at 9am it&amp;rsquo;s 10am.  At least I got a few important emails and things out of the way (I think), but so after making a slew of changes to the Slack greeter bots, I feel I can&amp;rsquo;t put off adding test frameworks any longer.  There&amp;rsquo;s some bugs going out that I can&amp;rsquo;t catch with simple automated tests (the way messages get formatted in a real slack instance), but I&amp;rsquo;ve definitely wasted a little time on some silly bugs that automated tests would have caught.  In the meantime I can see that the new changes to the syntax for the main greeter bot are all in place:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/30216/30053660-798a6e8c-9221-11e7-927d-ea20f462cc55.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and similarly for usernames in the project greeter bot:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/30216/30053820-fc5adbee-9221-11e7-8287-2934a0cd501c.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;although I note that even the bot mention of my own name in a channel does not appear to have created the kind of highlight I would like to see in the channel notifications (i.e. the number in the dot to indicate one mention of one&amp;rsquo;s name)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/30216/30053947-5a4bb106-9222-11e7-96de-eb3a1b66fddc.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;but at least we&amp;rsquo;ve got an automated way of giving new users the message that they should flag the maintainer&amp;rsquo;s name, in order to get attention.  I was hoping that simply mentioning the maintainer in the bot message might have this effect, but not so.  If the user follows the instruction to flag the maintainer in any question, it should be fine, but some people don&amp;rsquo;t understand that part of flagging in Slack - I&amp;rsquo;m looking to ensure that any question from a new person joining the channel gets noticed, but I guess I&amp;rsquo;m pushing too hard on a corner case &amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, as the number of features increases the need for tests mounts, and I think part of the problem here is that I haven&amp;rsquo;t yet mentally automatized the setup of tests in a NodeJS project.  I&amp;rsquo;ve done it so many times for Ruby that I can set up an RSpec or Cucumber suite from scratch without referring to any docs.  I have done it for NodeJS, but not enough that it&amp;rsquo;s second nature and it&amp;rsquo;s funny how a small thing like that can get in the way of getting something done.  Maybe I&amp;rsquo;ll need to athletic repeat that a few more times - I did do it every day for a couple of weeks in 2015, but not enough apparently &amp;hellip; :-)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s so hard&amp;ndash;where do I start?  Get a branch checked out for the issue I have on adding tests:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;tansaku@Samuels-MBP:~/Documents/Github/AgileVentures/greeter_bot &lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;master&lt;span class="o"&gt;)]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;
→ git checkout -b 4_add_tests
Switched to a new branch &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'4_add_tests'&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;install mocha:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;tansaku@Samuels-MBP:~/Documents/Github/AgileVentures/greeter_bot &lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;4_add_tests&lt;span class="o"&gt;)]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;
→ npm install --save-dev mocha
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;make a test directory and create a test:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;tansaku@Samuels-MBP:~/Documents/Github/AgileVentures/greeter_bot &lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;4_add_tests&lt;span class="o"&gt;)]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;
→ mkdir &lt;span class="nb"&gt;test&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;tansaku@Samuels-MBP:~/Documents/Github/AgileVentures/greeter_bot &lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;4_add_tests&lt;span class="o"&gt;)]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;
→ touch &lt;span class="nb"&gt;test&lt;/span&gt;/server_test.js
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;create a test file:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;assert&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;require&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'assert'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;describe&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'Bot'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(){&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;it&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'should include channel names in message'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(){&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;assert&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;equal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;update package.json&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight json"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;"name"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"greeter_bot"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;"version"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"1.0.0"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;"description"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;""&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;"main"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"server.js"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;"dependencies"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;"botkit"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"^0.4.3"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;"devDependencies"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;"mocha"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"^3.5.0"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;"scripts"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;"test"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"mocha test/**/*.js"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;"author"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;""&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;"license"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"ISC"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and that works:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;tansaku@Samuels-MBP:~/Documents/Github/AgileVentures/greeter_bot &lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;4_add_tests&lt;span class="o"&gt;)]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;
→ npm &lt;span class="nb"&gt;test&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;greeter_bot@1.0.0 &lt;span class="nb"&gt;test&lt;/span&gt; /Users/tansaku/Documents/GitHub/AgileVentures/greeter_bot
&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;mocha &lt;span class="nb"&gt;test&lt;/span&gt;/&lt;span class="k"&gt;**&lt;/span&gt;/&lt;span class="k"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;.js



  Bot
    ✓ should include channel names &lt;span class="k"&gt;in &lt;/span&gt;message


  1 passing &lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;6ms&lt;span class="o"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know how to do this - why was I hesitating? :-) But so now there&amp;rsquo;s not much to test in this project yet, at least not without some sophisticated mocking, which I&amp;rsquo;ll leave for later.  Let me at least check some trivial thing about the message being sent with the following code:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;chai&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;require&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'chai'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;expect&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;chai&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;expect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;greeting&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;require&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'./../lib/greeting'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;describe&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'Bot'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(){&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;it&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'should include linked techtalk channel in greeting'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(){&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;expect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;greeting&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;to&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;include&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'&amp;lt;#C02AA0ARR|techtalk&amp;gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;it&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'should include linked new_members channel in greeting'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(){&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;expect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;greeting&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;to&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;include&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'&amp;lt;#C02G8J689|new_members&amp;gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;it&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'should include linked random channel in greeting'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(){&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;expect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;greeting&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;to&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;include&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'&amp;lt;#C0285CSUH|random&amp;gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, so I got a bit fancy and installed chai so I could work with the expect/include syntax I like, and then I got all like &amp;ldquo;this project needs a proper structure&amp;rdquo; and moved things around.  I think it still works.  With only a couple of unit tests and no acceptance tests, I may have completely broken the project - my little local test that it starts up may conceal other issues &amp;hellip; but at least I&amp;rsquo;ve broken down some little mental barriers.  Starting node tests from scratch and reminding myself how we go through re-structuring a node app.  Some progress today - on to the continuing review tomorrow &amp;hellip; or add tests to project&lt;em&gt;greeter&lt;/em&gt;bot &amp;hellip; jump from level to level, enjoy, code!&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Got my jogging and podcasting/tweeting done this AM, but kids still off school, which means I&amp;rsquo;m late to the keyboard.  Lots to do - low hanging fruit is probably other changes to the greeter bots.  The change I rolled out on Friday seems to be working; that&amp;rsquo;s the quick fix to ensure that channel names are hyperlinked in messages:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/Screenshot%202017-09-04%2010.16.25.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I guess I should get that merged into master, and I can probably kick through the other minor changes there &amp;hellip; I&amp;rsquo;ve merged the license and code of conduct pull requests that I had outstanding.  So I punted on the code of conduct in the greeter bot, posting the following to our AV community channel:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;we&amp;rsquo;ve been discussing codes of conduct before and I know that various projects have them now, following GitHub&amp;rsquo;s lead of making them really easy to add.  I haven&amp;rsquo;t heard any objections yet, and I just added them as a recommendation in our &amp;ldquo;Getting Started&amp;rdquo; documentation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m planning to add mention of them to our Slack greeter bot https://github.com/AgileVentures/greeter&lt;em&gt;bot/issues/6 but I thought I&amp;rsquo;d just check in with the community again before moving on that.  Would be good to discuss in a community meeting - which perhaps we should move to Fridays &amp;hellip; anyhow more on meeting times soon, but very interested in any input anyone cares to share here, or feel free to DM me directly :slightly&lt;/em&gt;smiling_face:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I got hyperlinks to our Premium mob offer and the user name in the main greeting bot, and pushed those live from a branch. I&amp;rsquo;m really promising myself that the next step is testing!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But before that I can&amp;rsquo;t help myself but try and get the names and channels linked up in the project greeter bot, so I went ahead and did that and ended up doing a quick manual test on the now un-used AV mentors slack instance, that allowed for a quick round of debugging.  Gosh I&amp;rsquo;m really not setting this up to allow for easy-onboarding of others - will need a big documentation effort to get folks into the new AV bot testing slack instance &amp;hellip; can&amp;rsquo;t help myself but get these quick fixes out first - actually make it so that there will be the equivalent of a ping to the project maintainers on channel join - or at least see if hyperlinking their name in the bot post has that effect &amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
